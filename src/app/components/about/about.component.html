          Thanks for taking the time to come visit! Jess here. Mom. Friend.
          Nomad. Body positivity activist. Animal lover. Creator behind Project:
          Self Love. Co creator of three amazing little humans. I have been a
          portrait photographer for ten years and have worked and traveled all
          over the country but have settled down in the Nashville area. I began
          my photography education as a means to capturing my own family and
          life but as a student of humanity, I quickly fell in love with being
          present for and documenting other people's lives, along with all the
          big and little events along the way. From births, to weddings, babies
          and families, I'm here to help you freeze time. My photography style
          is collaborative and documentary and I'm interested in capturing you
          and your loved ones exactly as you are.
